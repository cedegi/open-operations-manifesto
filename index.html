  <h1></h1>
  
  <p>Open Infrastructure technology has become increasingly mature. However, the greatest software is useless if it cannot be operated confidently. For this to happen, skills and knowledge must be built up, fostered and retained. In an increasingly competitive market for skilled people and increasingly complex IT systems, this is becoming an ever-greater challenge for governments, institutions, and companies. How can we operate digital offerings in a self-determined, secure and qualitatively excellent manner?</p>

<p>While software as a means of production has been and is being increasingly collectivized thanks to the open source movement, organizations continue to protect operational knowledge like a holy grail. How sovereign can an organization act, if precisely this important knowledge only adds to the lottery factor? The answer to this must be the collectivization of operational knowledge, just as it is being practiced for many years with software code. So, we need to build communities who collaborate on exchanging and recording this experience and the tooling built to simplify the automation of operational processes. We create a climate in which operations is not supposed to never make any mistakes – instead we create infrastructure that is robust against mistakes and a culture where openly talking about mistakes – even beyond organizational boundaries – and learning from them is appreciated and considered a strength. We learn more from our mistakes than from our successes – usually because we analyze them much more intensely.</p>

<p>We are still at the beginning of a new movement, which is becoming increasingly important as the overall complexity of software stacks increases. For true self-determination in the ever-growing digital realm, we urgently need to build skills and share the gained knowledge freely and in unlimited ways also in the realm of operational knowledge — exactly the way we started with software code almost 40 years ago. Let’s start closing the gap to have open source style collaboration not just for the Dev piece in DevOps. And this is just another urgently needed piece to enhance and grow the overall digital capabilities for achieving sovereignty in the digital realm.</p>
